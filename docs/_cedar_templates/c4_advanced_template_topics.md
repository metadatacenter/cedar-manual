CEDAR Metadata Templates—all CEDAR templating resources—are really modeling tools. 
These tools define what information is important to collect, 
what that information means (in terms a computer can understand and analyze),
and how that information is organized and internally connected.

In this chapter we describe how you can use CEDAR to achieve common design goals.
We review common patterns like metadata profiling and extensions, 
versioning your metadata models, 
and versioning the vocabularies you want to use. 
And we present details about our value suggestion ("Intelligent Authoring")
system so that you can decide exactly where suggestions are most appropriate in your forms.
