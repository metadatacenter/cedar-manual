**artifact**: any of template, element, field, instance. All CEDAR artifacts 
are specified using <a href="https://more.metadatacenter.org/tools-training/outreach/cedar-template-model" target="_blank">CEDAR's Template Model</a>.

---

**CEDAR Workbench**: suite of web-based tools and RESTful APIs that allow users 
to construct templates, populate templates with metadata, and to share and 
manage these resources.

---

**copy**: make a copy of an artifact to a given folder.

---

**details panel**: right-hand panel that shows the details of a particular 
template or folder.

---

**draft**: a CEDAR artifact that has not been published, and therefore has no version
identifier. All new CEDAR artifacts start in the draft status.

---

**element**: reusable artifact that may contain one or more fields and/or one 
or more nested elements.

*e.g.: address element with three fields: street, city, and ZIP code*

---

**element designer**: component of the CEDAR Workbench that allows users to 
construct elements.

---

**field**: reusable artifact used to capture an atomic piece of metadata.

*e.g.: title, description, start date*

---

**field designer**: component of the CEDAR Workbench that allows users to 
construct fields.

---

**finder**: dialog which allows you to select a library component to add to 
your template or element.

---

**folder**: storage space where CEDAR artifacts and other folders can be 
placed together.

---

**global, global open**: globally accessible without logging in, aka 
public, FAIR.

---

**group**: logical collection of CEDAR users.

---

**instance**: set of metadata values resulting from a populated template.

*e.g.: title = "Study about CRC", start date = "03/07/2014", 
ZIP code = "94305", etc.*

---

**library component**: a reusable field or element.

---

**metadata editor**: component of the CEDAR Workbench that allows users to 
create metadata by populating templates with values.

---

**metadata repository**: centralized place where all CEDAR artifacts are 
stored. CEDAR's metadata repository stores templates, elements, fields, 
and instances.

---

**move**: change the location of a resource (an artifact or a folder) to a selected folder.

---

**notification**: information shown by the CEDAR Workbench to a particular 
user or group of users to inform them when a particular event related to their 
CEDAR resources occurs.

---

**open** (an artifact): present an editing interface that allows a user to modify the artifact.

---

**populate**: create an instance from a template and add or edit metadata in the instance.

---

**publish**: specify that the status of an artifact is final, and have the user assign a version to it. 
Published artifacts cannot be modified or deleted.

---

**resource**: any of template, element, field, instance, folder, user, group 
(CEDAR RESTful resources).

---

**resource manager**: primary front-end component of the CEDAR Workbench that 
allows users to search, browse, and manage CEDAR resources.

---

**share**: allow a user or group of users to have access permissions (read-only, 
or read + write) to an artifact or folder (folder access permissions are
inherited recursively to all content in that folder).

---

**side navigation panel**: left-hand panel that shows create and search 
options.

---

**submission**: metadata content that is sent out from CEDAR into another repository 
(may also include data).

---

**submit**: send metadata to a repository, possibly along with data files.

---

**template**: group of fields and/or elements that specifies what metadata 
is to be collected for a specific purpose.

*e.g.: study template with three fields: title, description, start date, and 
one element: address*

---

**template designer**: component of the CEDAR Workbench that allows users to 
construct templates, also known as a form builder.

---

**toolbar**: template designer's vertical selection of tools, used 
to select a library component to add to the template or to find other elements
or fields; found floating on the right-hand side of the user interface.

---

**user**: a person who has created an account on the CEDAR Workbench and who 
uses any of its tools.

---

**version**: way to categorize the different states of an artifact by giving
it a sequence identifier. CEDAR artifacts must be published to have a version.

---

**workspace**: folder that acts as the default storage location for all the 
CEDAR reources created by a user.
