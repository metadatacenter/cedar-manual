You can view the search resources either as a grid of different resource tiles (as shown in the figure below) or as a list of different resources. You can switch between these views using the icon highlighted in the small blue rectangle in the upper right of the figure. 

You can also sort the different resources based on their titles, creation dates, and modification dates. To sort the resources, click on the sort icon highlighted in the small red rectangle at upper right, and select from the desired option that pops up. You can also click on the column header to sort by that column.

In the next section, we will discuss how to constrain the search results by filtering on the different resource types.
