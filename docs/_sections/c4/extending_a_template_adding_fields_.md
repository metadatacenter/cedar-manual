## Introduction


## How to Extend a Template

make a copy

rename appropriately

add a comment (optional)


## Letting Users Add Their Own Fields

simple as using the Attribute-Value field type

doesn't really create a new specification

## Creating an Extended Specification

many specifications are extended for additional uses (sometimes called profiling, alas)

after basic steps, add your desired field, at end or (for eximple templates) inline

if you want inline but inside an element are used, 
they would have to be extended themselves
